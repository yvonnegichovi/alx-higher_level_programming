All your scripts will be tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
All your Bash scripts should be exactly 3 lines long (wc -l file should print 3)
All your files should end with a new line
All your files must be executable
The first line of all your bash files should be exactly #!/bin/bash
The second line of all your Bash scripts should be a comment explaining what the script is doing
All curl commands must have the option -s (silent mode)
All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python3 (version 3.8.5)
The first line of all your Python files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)
All your modules should be documented using python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'
All your classes should be documented using python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)'
All your functions (inside and outside a class) should be documented using python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)'
A documentation is not a simple word, itâ€™s a real sentence explaining the purpose of the module, class, or method (the length of it will be verified)
