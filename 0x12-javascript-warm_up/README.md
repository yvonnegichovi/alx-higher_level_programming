Project: 0x12. JavaScript - Warm up

Overview

This project aims to introduce meu to the basics of JavaScript programming, focusing on scripting and understanding fundamental concepts. Through a series of tasks, I'll explore variables, data types, control flow, functions, and more.

Background Context

JavaScript is a versatile language used for scripting and web front-end development. Understanding its fundamentals is crucial for building dynamic web applications.

Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, I should be able to explain and demonstrate:

Why JavaScript programming is amazing
How to run a JavaScript script
Creating variables and constants
Differences between var, const, and let
Available data types in JavaScript
Using control flow statements (if, if ... else)
Implementing loops (while, for)
Defining and using functions
Understanding scope of variables
Manipulating dictionaries
Importing files

Requirements

Editors: vi, vim, emacs
Operating System: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
Interpreter: Node.js (version 14.x)
Linting: Semistandard (version 16.x.x)
Documentation: README.md file is mandatory
Execution: All files must be executable
Code Style: Compliant with Semistandard rules and AirBnB style
Additional Info: Install Node.js 14 and Semistandard using provided commands

Tasks

Below is a list of tasks to be completed as part of this project:

0. First constant, first print: Print "JavaScript is amazing" using a constant variable.
1. 3 languages: Print three lines with specified messages.
2. Arguments: Print a message based on the number of arguments passed.
3. Value of my argument: Print the first argument passed to the script.
4. Create a sentence: Print two arguments in the format " is ".
5. An Integer: Print the first argument converted to an integer or "Not a number".
6. Loop to languages: Print three lines using an array of strings and a loop.
7. I love C: Print "C is fun" x times (where x is the first argument).
8. Square: Print a square with a size determined by the first argument.
9. Add: Print the addition of two integers.
10. Factorial: Compute and print a factorial using recursion.
11. Second biggest!: Search and print the second biggest integer from the arguments.
12. Object: Update a script to replace a value in an object.
13. Add file: Write a function to return the addition of two integers and make it visible from outside.

Conclusion

This project will help me familiarize yourself with JavaScript basics and prepare me for more advanced topics in web development.
