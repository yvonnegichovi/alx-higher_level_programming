HIGH-LEVEL PROGRAMMING

This is the second sprint for ALX Software Engineering Prrogram. It invloves learning and practicing of high level programmiing languages such as Python. Python langauge was invented by Guido van Rossum who renamed it after his favorite comedy group Monty Python, specifically the television series "Monty Python Flying Circus". 

Below is a collection of guiding principles for writing programs in thr Python language. It was written by Tim Peters one of the contributors to the Python community. These guidelines are referred to as PEP 20 (Python Enhancement Proposal 20), or simply The Zen of Python:
Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one—and preferably only one—obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than right now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea—let's do more of those!
